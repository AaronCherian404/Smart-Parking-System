# 🚗 Smart Parking System using Arduino, ESP32, and Blynk  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Smart Parking System** using **Arduino, ESP32**, and **Blynk** for real-time parking slot monitoring. The system helps manage parking space availability efficiently by integrating IoT-based sensors with a user-friendly web interface.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Parking slot status is updated in real-time.  
- **Web Interface**: A clean and interactive dashboard for viewing parking availability.  
- **Blynk Integration**: Remotely monitor parking status using the Blynk app.  
- **ESP32 & Arduino Integration**: Uses ESP32 for connectivity and Arduino for sensor control.

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements  
- ✅ **Arduino Uno** (or similar microcontroller)  
- ✅ **ESP32** (for WiFi connectivity)  
- ✅ **Ultrasonic Sensors** (or IR sensors for detecting vehicle presence)  
- ✅ **LED Indicators** (optional, for visual slot status)  
- ✅ **Blynk App** (for remote monitoring)  

## 💾 Software Requirements  
- **Arduino IDE** (for programming the microcontrollers)  
- **Blynk App** (for remote monitoring)  
- **ESP32 Board Support Package**  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for web dashboard)  

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Setting Up Arduino & ESP32  
- Install the **Arduino IDE** and add the ESP32 board package.  
- Upload `code_of_the_arduino.ino` to the Arduino board.  
- Upload `Working_code_for_the_esp32.ino` to the ESP32 board.  

### 2️⃣ Web Dashboard Setup  
- Open `index.html` in a browser to monitor parking slot availability.  

### 3️⃣ Connecting to Blynk  
- Download the **Blynk App** on your phone.  
- Set up a **new project** and obtain the **authentication token**.  
- Modify the ESP32 code to include your **Blynk authentication token** and **WiFi credentials**.  

## 📌 Usage  
- The system detects available and occupied parking slots.  
- The web interface updates in real-time, displaying slot availability.  
- Users can remotely monitor the parking status using the **Blynk App**.
